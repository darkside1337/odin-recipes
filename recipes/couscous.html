      This recipe is made with mutton and chicken, but you can easily change the
      meats for lamb and/or merguez. I make this often and my family loves it!
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
      <li>2 cups couscous</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons harissa</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For every cup of couscous, you'll need about 1.5 cups of water or broth.
        Add the liquid to a saucepan and bring it to a boil. You can season the
        liquid with a pinch of salt for extra flavor if desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the liquid is boiling, remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the
        couscous to the liquid in a 1:1 ratio (1 cup of couscous for every 1 cup
        of boiling liquid).
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly stir the couscous to ensure it's evenly distributed in the
        liquid. Cover the saucepan with a lid and let it sit for about 5
        minutes. The couscous will absorb the liquid and steam.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the steaming time, use a fork to fluff the couscous. Gently break
        apart any clumps by raking the fork through the grains. This step helps
        ensure the couscous is light and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        If desired, drizzle a bit of olive oil or melted butter over the
        couscous and fluff it again with the fork. This adds flavor and prevents
        the grains from sticking together. Taste and adjust the seasoning as
        needed. Your couscous is now ready to be served as a side dish or as a
        base for other dishes.
